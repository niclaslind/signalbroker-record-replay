# signalbroker-record-replay

With this application, my intention is to create a signal-recorder, that record signals from the [SignalBrokerServer](https://github.com/volvo-cars/signalbroker-server/)
and after, we should be able to replay the signals with the same timestamp so to say.

But now, the only thing I have done is to create the communication with the signalbroker, I have been able to publish signals to signalbroker, but not subscribe yet.
